This is one of my biggest proyects. I enjoyed making it { A LOT }. I had to redo it at least 6 times, until I got to the current result. 

It is made with ReactJS and various libraries.

I first tried to do it with HTML, CSS, and JS. I realized that to achieve what I wanted I needed to use features from modern frameworks like React. Before trying it in React, I tried doing it with Gatsby. The result was good, but I wanted to keep practicing my development skills, and I was learning ReactJS, so I decided to build it from scratch. I modeled the whole idea with Figma (which I was also learning), and started. It took me about 1 month and a half to have a presentable result. It is definitely not perfect, it has a lot of bad practices, but it allowed me to learn a lot of new things.
